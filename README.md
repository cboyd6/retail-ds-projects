# retail-ds-projects
Portfolio of retail data science projects demonstrating forecasting, regression, cohort analysis, labor optimization, and operational insights.

First project: ***Retail Sales Performance.***


I will break each project down into 9 Data Science steps:

1. Problem and Objective
> * To define the goal we are trying to achieve, before looking at any data
> * Define success metrics and any constraints
2. Extract Transform Load, **ETL**
> * Extract the raw data
> * Transform/parse data to expected formats
> * Load to 
3. Cleaning and Preprocessing
> * Remove or fix any errors in the data; missing values, typos, duplicates
> * Perform scaling and normalization
> * Standardize formats
4. Exploratory Data Analysis, **EDA**
> * Explore data looking for trends, correlations, seasonality
> * Include Visualizations of data to reinforce
> * Engineer new feature from the data (rolling averages) 
5. Statistical Modelling / Machine learning
> * Build statistical models to achieve the goal set out in step one.
> * Split data in Train/ Validation / Test
6. Evaluation and Validation
> * Evaluate model performance wrt different types of error
> * Check for overfitting / underfitting
7. Prescription/ Buisness Recommendation/ Optimization
> * Translate models outcome in to actionable business decisions
8. Presentation and Reporting
> * Create presentable visuals, dashboards, summary tables, and reports to communicate findings
9. Deployment and Monitoring
> * If applicable, describe how the model would be used in production and how it will be monitored
